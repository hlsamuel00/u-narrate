## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Handlebars, Materialize CSS, CSS, Express.js, and Passport.js

I was able to get a handle on the backend with this project. This project was my first full-scale backend build. I was able to utilize Express.js to make building the server. I utilized the MVC architecture to structure the application which made breakdown much easier. I constructed my routes, controllers, middleware, and models and have them in their respective folders. I was able to get a better grasp on model Schemas and how they interact with the database. I also was able to implement sessions to ensure that users were redirected to the main page/dashboard as they logged back in. This was also my first experience working with Passport.js, but out of the box, it had amazing usability and ease of use.

## Optimizations
I want to get the Official Google Authentication button added to the login page. I will continue to work on this as well as getting the Facebook and Apple ID logins up and running.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a great deal building this project:
  * Backend - I developed a better sense of how the backend is structured and how all parts of MVC communicate with each other
  * Authentication - I utilized Passport.js to take advantage of the authentication packages which made authentication for users easier
  * Architecture - This was my first introduction into MVC which helped make the structure for my application much more streamlined. 
  * Templating Language - Previously I was using EJS for my templating, but love the syntax of HandleBars a bit more. I will continue to explore different templates to find my groove and the pros and cons of each.
